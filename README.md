## Fundamental analysis
This strategy focuses on a company's track record and reliability, using metrics like P/E ratios to pinpoint stocks with potential value growth. It's built on the premise that profitable businesses will sustain their success, driven by market rewards and uptrends.
## Technical Analysis
This method is based on using time series analysis on historical trends to forecast future pricing. To forecast the ensuing trends, statistical methods like Bollinger Bands and simple moving averages are used.
##  Modern approach to Stock market analysis

###  Qualitative Analysis
Bad news rapidly impacts stock markets, fostering unpredictability. The strong connection between media, social media, and stocks intensifies this influence. Equities mirroring each other during crises contribute to market crashes. Twitter, a swift and reliable media source, plays a pivotal role. Combining news and Twitter feeds with sentiment analysis unveils succinct insights into public opinions on corporations.

### Quantitative Analysis 
Most markets now have easy access to historical data. We can apply a variety of machine learning models to this dataset in order to provide precise results for next investments. These models can have their bias for the majority of reflected attributes changed and trained for individual stocks. Additionally, these models can be trained to function in many settings and with general market fluctuations.

## Methodology
The aim of this project is to build an application which outputs accurate 
recommendations in a quantifiable manner. For this purpose, 3 modules are 
implemented which are as follows:
- Machine Learning module
- Sentiment Analysis module
- Fuzzy logic Module

These modules are integrated into a Recommendation Model in the following manner as shown in Fig.
